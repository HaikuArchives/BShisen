BShisen
=======

BeOS tile matching game.  Circa 1999

Please note that this is version 1.2pre of BShisen.
The original author, Kelvin W. Sherlock, couldn't locate the source for version 1.3 and 1.4.
Also note that it doesn't yet compile because of a missing "stack.cpp" file.
Keeping it here, while I wait for it to be added to the HaikuArchives repo.
